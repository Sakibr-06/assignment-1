    <hr />
    <p>
      Creating a webpage using all
      <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags involves
      designing a page that incorporates the full <i>range</i> of HTML elements
      to demonstrate their functionality and how they can be used in practice.
      HTML provides a framework for structuring content on the web, and
      understanding how each tag works is essential for effective web
      development.

      Description: <br />
      This webpage serves as a comprehensive demonstration of all HTML tags,
      showcasing their uses and functionalities in a single, coherent example.
      The page is structured to illustrate how different HTML elements work
      together to build a complete, functional webpage.Below is a breakdown of
      the main sections and elements used:
    </p>

      define the HTML5 document type. <br />
      ~The <b>'< html>'</b> element wraps the entire document, with
      <b>'< head>'</b> and <b>'< body>'</b>
      sections defining the metadata and content respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark>2.Head Section:</mark><br />
